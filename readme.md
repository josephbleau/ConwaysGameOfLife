<h2>Description:</h2>

Conway's Game of Life is an application which demonstrates how a small set of rules can enable and produce complex and unpredictable emergent behavior. It is in a classification of applications known as 'cellular automata.' It is a grid of cells which are either alive, or dead, and which will either be born, or die, based on specific criterion. 

<b>The simulation rules:</b>
- If a cell is surrounded by only one live cell, it dies, as if by starvation.
- If a cell is surrounded by two or three cells, and is alive, it remains alive.
- If a cell is surrounded by more than three cells, it dies, as if by over-crowding.
- If a cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it comes to life, as if by reproduction.


<h2>Visual:</h2>
This is a simple scene from my application. The application can be configured to use any grid size. It automatically redraws when re-sized. It can be paused, cleared, and restarted.
